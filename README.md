Unregistry is a lightweight container image registry that stores and serves images directly from your Docker daemon's
storage.

The included `docker pussh` command (extra 's' for SSH) lets you push images straight to remote Docker servers over SSH.
It transfers only the missing layers, making it fast and efficient.

## The problem

You've built a Docker image locally. Now you need it on your server. Your options suck:

- **Docker Hub / GitHub Container Registry** - Your code is now public, or you're paying for private repos
- **Self-hosted registry** - Another service to maintain, secure, and pay for storage
- **Save/Load** - `docker save | ssh | docker load` transfers the entire image, even if 90% already exists on the server
- **Rebuild remotely** - Wastes time and server resources. Plus now you're debugging why the build fails in production

You just want to move an image from A to B. Why is this so hard?

## The solution

```bash
docker push myapp:latest user@server
```

That's it. Your image is on the remote server. No registry setup, no subscription, no intermediate storage, no 
exposed ports. Just a **direct transfer** of the **missing layers** over SSH.

Here's what happens under the hood:
1. Establishes SSH tunnel to the remote server
2. Starts a temporary unregistry container
3. Forwards a random localhost port to the unregistry port over the tunnel
4. `docker push` to unregistry through the forwarded port, transferring only the layers that don't already exist 
   remotely. The transferred image is instantly available on the remote Docker daemon
5. Stops the unregistry container and closes the SSH tunnel

It's like `rsync` for Docker images ‚Äî simple and efficient.

> [!NOTE]  
> Unregistry was created for [Uncloud](https://github.com/psviderski/uncloud), a lightweight tool for deploying 
> containers across multiple Docker hosts. We needed something simpler than a full registry but more efficient than
> save/load.

## Installation

### macOS/Linux via Homebrew

```bash
brew install psviderski/tap/docker-pussh
```

After installation, to use `docker-pussh` as a Docker CLI plugin (`docker pussh` command) you need to create a symlink:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.docker/cli-plugins
ln -sf $(brew --prefix)/bin/docker-pussh ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-pussh
```

### macOS/Linux via direct download

```bash
# Download the latest version
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psviderski/unregistry/main/docker-pussh \
  -o ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-pussh

# Make it executable
chmod +x ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-pussh
```

### Windows

Windows is not currently supported, but you can try using [WSL 2](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/features/wsl/) 
with the above Linux instructions.

### Verify installation

```bash
docker pussh --help
```

## Usage

Push an image to a remote server. Please make sure the SSH user has permissions to run `docker` commands (user is 
`root` or non-root user is in `docker` group). If `sudo` is required, ensure the user can run `sudo docker` without 
a password prompt.

```bash
docker pussh myapp:latest user@server.example.com
```

With SSH key authentication if the private key is not added to your SSH agent:

```bash
docker pussh myapp:latest ubuntu@192.168.1.100 -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Using a custom SSH port:

```bash
docker pussh myapp:latest user@server:2222
```

Push a specific platform for a multi-platform image. The local Docker has to use
[containerd image store](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/features/containerd/) to support multi-platform images.

```bash
docker pussh myapp:latest user@server --platform linux/amd64
```

## Use cases

### Deploy to production servers

Build locally and push directly to your production servers. No middleman.

```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t myapp:1.2.3 .
docker pussh myapp:1.2.3 deploy@prod-server
ssh deploy@prod-server docker run -d myapp:1.2.3
```

### CI/CD pipelines

Skip the registry complexity in your pipelines. Build and push directly to deployment targets.

```yaml
- name: Build and deploy
  run: |
    docker build -t myapp:${{ github.sha }} .
    docker pussh myapp:${{ github.sha }} deploy@staging-server
```

### Homelab and air-gapped environments

Distribute images in isolated networks without exposing them to the internet.

```bash
docker pussh image:latest user@192.168.1.100
```

## Requirements

### On local machine
- Docker CLI with plugin support (Docker 19.03+)
- OpenSSH client

### On remote server
- Docker is installed and running
- SSH user has permissions to run `docker` commands (user is `root` or non-root user is in `docker` group)
- If `sudo` is required, ensure the user can run `sudo docker` without a password prompt

> [!TIP]
> The remote Docker daemon works best with [containerd image store](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/containerd/)
> enabled. This allows unregistry to access images more efficiently.
>
> Add the following configuration to `/etc/docker/daemon.json` on the remote server and restart the `docker` service:
> ```json
> {
>   "features": {
>     "containerd-snapshotter": true
>   }
> }
> ```

## Advanced usage

### Running unregistry standalone

Sometimes you want a local registry without the overhead. Unregistry works great for this:

```bash
# Run unregistry locally and expose it on port 5000
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name unregistry \
  -v /run/containerd/containerd.sock:/run/containerd/containerd.sock \
  ghcr.io/psviderski/unregistry

# Use it like any registry
docker tag myapp:latest localhost:5000/myapp:latest
docker push localhost:5000/myapp:latest
```

### Custom SSH options

Need custom SSH settings? Use the standard SSH config file:

```bash
# ~/.ssh/config
Host prod-server
    HostName server.example.com
    User deploy
    Port 2222
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/deploy_key

# Now just use
docker pussh myapp:latest prod-server
```
